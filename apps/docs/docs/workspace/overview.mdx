# Workspace

Everything you do in AutoRepl takes place in a workspace it's like a home. A workspace has members. It can be only you, your team, or the entire company.

Your plan is tied to your workspace. It means that if you have a Personal Pro workspace and you create a new workspace it will be by default a Free workspace.

You can create as many workspaces as you want.
