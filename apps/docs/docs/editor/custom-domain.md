# Add a custom domain

You can bind a custom domain to your typebot in the "Share" tab.

<img
  src="/img/custom-domain/add-domain.png"
  width="700"
  alt="Add my domain button"
/>

To connect a new domain, follow the instructions:

<img
  src="/img/custom-domain/instructions.png"
  width="700"
  alt="Add domain instructions"
/>

Once you've added the corresponding DNS record, click on the "Save" button. You might have to wait for a few minutes before the record is properly propagated.
