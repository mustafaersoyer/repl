# Overview

Blocks are the atomic building blocks of a typebot chat. You can chain any blocks together to create complexe conversation flows. They are grouped into sub-categories to make it easier to find the right block for your needs:

## Bubbles

Bubble blocks are used to show bubbles that can be used to display information to the user.

  width="100%"
  style={{ maxWidth: '300px' }}
  alt="Bubble blocks"
/>

## Inputs

Input blocks are used to ask the user for input. It will stop the conversation and for the user to provide input.

/>

## Logic

Logic blocks are used to perform background operations. They are not visible to the users.
