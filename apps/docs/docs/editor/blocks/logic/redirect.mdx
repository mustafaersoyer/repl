# Redirect

The Redirect logic block allows you to redirect your user to a given URL either on the current tab or in a new tab.

<img
  src="/img/blocks/logic/redirect.png"
  width="100%"
  style={{ maxWidth: '600px' }}
  alt="Redirect logic block"
/>

:::caution
Safari and iOS devices will block a redirect in a new tab by default and display a message that says "A popup has been blocked, would you like to open it?". To never stumble upon this issue, a redirect on the current page is preferable.
