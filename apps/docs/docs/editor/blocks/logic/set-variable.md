# Set variable

The "Set variable" block allows you to set a particular value to a variable.

This value can be any kind of plain text but also **Javascript code**.

## Expressions with existing variables

It means you can apply operations on existing variables.

Add a value to your variable:

```
{{Score}} + 5
```

Compute a sum of variables:

```
{{Score}} + {{Answer}}
```

Multiply variables together:

```
{{Score}} * {{Multiplier}}
```

Compute a percentage:

```
{{Score}} * 100 / {{Max Score}}
```

## Current Date

You can create a `Submitted at` (or any other name) variable using this code:

```js
new Date().toISOString()
```

It will set the variable to the current date and time.

## Random ID

Or a random ID:

```js
Math.round(Math.random() * 1000000)
```

## Current URL

A popular request also is to set a variable to the current URL. Here is the value that should be inserted:

```js
window.location.href
```

:::caution
It will not give you the parent URL if you embed the bot on your site.
A more bulletproof option is to pass the URL as a hidden variable in the embed code options. You can find an example [here](/embed/html-javascript#additional-configuration).

## Extract a cookie

This code allows you to extract the value of a cookie called "my_cookie":

```js
const getCookie = (name) => {
  const value = `; ${document.cookie}`
  const parts = value.split(`; ${name}=`)
  if (parts.length === 2) return parts.pop().split(';').shift()
  return 'not found'
}

return getCookie('my_cookie')
```

As you can see the code can also be multi-line. The Set variable block will get the value following the `return` statement.
