# Variables

Variables are placeholders for content that you can then use anywhere in the Typebot. It's a very important concept to understand to truly create a customized experience for the user.

## Save an answer in a variable

You can tell your input step to save the answer into a variable and reuse then in a further bubble for example:

<img src="/img/variables/question.png" width="800" alt="Iframe preview" />

## Advanced concepts

Here is a quick video that showcases advanced concepts about variables:

### Prefilled variables

By default, any declared variables in the bot can be prefilled by passing initial values in the URL.

Let's say I have a variable named "Email" somewhere in my bot. This variable can be passed as a URL parameter. If I'm launching my bot using this URL:

`https://typebot.io/my-bot?Email=test@test.com`

Then if an input step is saving the answer into this variable, it will be first prefilled with this initial value. It can greatly improve the user experience if you already have data about him.

Prefilling variables using the embed library is even easier. You need to add an object named `hiddenVariables` that contains a dictionary of your values. For example:

```js
Typebot.initBubble({
  url: `https://viewer.typebot.io/typebot-support`,
  hiddenVariables: {
    'User ID': '123',
    'First name': 'John',
    Email: 'test@test.com',
  },
})
```

### Hidden variables

These are simply variables that are declared in the bot flow but aren't displayed to the user anywhere. This allows you to add some context to a session for example a User ID, a `utm_source` parameter (in the case of a marketing campaign), or anything else.

To enable this, you just have to make sure that the variables exist in the variables dropdown:

<img src="/img/variables/declaring.png" width="300" alt="Iframe preview" />

(This dropdown can be found in any place where you can add variables. It is global to your bot flow.)

Then the values will be available on the Results page in specific columns:

<img
  src="/img/variables/hiddenVariablesResults.png"
  width="500"
  alt="Iframe preview"
/>
