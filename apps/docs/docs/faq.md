# FAQ

## Is human takeover is available on AutoRepl?

No, AutoRepl is specifically built for async chats. I believe Live Chat is a whole other product. But you can integrate AutoRepl with Chatwoot.

You can still implement great customer support with AutoRepl by using a ticketing system such as [Freshdesk](https://freshdesk.com/) or [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/). You can create a ticket each time your user answers the bot.
