[AutoRepl](https://www.autorepl.com) AutoRepl is a SaaS where anyone can create free chatbots that they can easily use and integrate into all platforms. It allows you to create conversational apps/forms (Lead qualification, Product launch, User onboarding, Customer support), embed them anywhere on your web/mobile apps, and collect results in real-time.

This is the AutoRepl documentation. It's a great place to find most answers. Please use the search box in the top right or the navigation menu (soon available) on the left-hand side to find the answers you're looking for.
