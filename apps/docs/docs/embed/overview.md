# Overview

You can choose to embed your bot in 3 different ways.

## Standard

Embeds the bot in a box with the size of your choice anywhere on your app. This is what is used on bot homepage:

<img src="/img/embeddings/standard.webp" alt="Standard"/>

You can also set the width to `100%` and the height to `100vh` to make it take the entire page dimensions

## Popup

Embeds the bot in a Popup that overlays your website. It can be triggered after a delay or with a click of a button for example

<img src="/img/embeddings/popup.webp" alt="Popup"/>

## Bubble

Embeds the bot as a "chat bubble" at the bottom right corner of your site. Can be triggered automatically or with a click. It can also come with a "proactive message".

<img src="/img/embeddings/bubble1.webp" alt="Bubble 1" width="600px"/>
