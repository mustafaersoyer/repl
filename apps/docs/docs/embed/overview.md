# Overview

You can choose to embed your typebot in 3 different ways.

## Standard

Embeds the typebot in a box with the size of your choice anywhere on your app. This is what is used on Typebot homepage:

<img src="/img/embeddings/standard.png" alt="Standard"/>

You can also set the width to `100%` and the height to `100vh` to make it take the entire page dimensions

## Popup

Embeds the typebot in a Popup that overlays your website. It can be triggered after a delay or with a click of a button for example

<img src="/img/embeddings/popup.png" alt="Popup"/>

## Bubble

Embeds the typebot as a "chat bubble" at the bottom right corner of your site. Can be triggered automatically or with a click. It can also come with a "proactive message".
