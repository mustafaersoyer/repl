# Iframe

You can easily get your bot iframe code by clicking on the "Iframe" button in the "Share" tab of your bot.

<img src="/img/embeddings/iframe/iframe-preview.webp" width="600" alt="Iframe preview"/>

Here, you can set up its width and height. A good default is a `width` of `100%` and a `height` of `600px`.
