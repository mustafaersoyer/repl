Build beautiful conversational forms

== Description ==
Collect 4x more responses with your conversational forms using Typebot.

üëâ Build beautiful conversational forms and embed them directly in your applications without a line of code.
üëâ Typebot helps you publish forms that feel native to your product and it provides the best experience for your users.
üëâ With Typebot, you collect the answer as soon as the user answers the first question. You get to know exactly when the user tends to drop your form.

This plugin relies on Typebot which is a tool that allows you to create conversational forms and directly integrate them on your Wordpress site.
